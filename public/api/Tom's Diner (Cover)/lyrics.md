I am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter for the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway, and before I even argue
He is looking out the window at somebody coming in
"It is always nice to see you"
Says the man behind the counter to the woman who was coming
She is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way as they are kissing their hello's
And I'm pretending not to see them
And instead I pour the milk
Oh, no
"It is always nice to see you"
"It is always nice to see you"
"It is always nice to see you"
"It is always nice to see you"
It is al-al-always nice (al-al-always nice)
It is always nice to see you
Always nice to see you
It is al-al-always nice
Oh, it is al-al-always nice
Oh, "it is always nice to see you"
"Always nice"
"It is always nice to see you"
