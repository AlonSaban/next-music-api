Yeah
Honestly, I'm sick of death and hearing the complains
Everybody wants to tell me how I've changed
I think somehow I'm responsible for bodies filling graves
If I made the songs they wanted, were they fans I could have saved?
Man, that's a lotta weight
Wait, I thought it would be great to entertain
And now I understand why mumble rappers say the things they say
They don't want any obligation to the fanbase they create
I guess my morals won't allow me to be famous if it's fake
I barely made it, I was livin' in the ghetto always prayin'
My potential wouldn't go to waste before I could escape it
I just had a mental breakdown
Rent was due, I couldn't pay it
Killing roaches, scraping guts off all the plates and being patient, ay

Livin' in the hood could have got me kill
Kitchen full of rats, stomach never fill
They cut off the lights, couldn't pay the bills
I was always sick, couldn't buy the pills

Girlfriend almost left me
We were broken, we were desperate
Right before it got too heavy
I went viral, off a record, ay

Never signed the deal, I did it on my own
I made all the beats, I write every song
Did not all believe I did it all alone
Told me I was weak I show 'em I was strong
Never should have bet against me
Thought my anxiety was gonna rack me
Thought my depression will get to my head for a second and leave
But they never left me

Everybody says I've changed up, I've changed up
'Cause I had nothing then I came up, came up
Now I'm someone they are afraid of, afraid of
So say some, say some, woah
Ay, yo, everything you say bro
I don't care, no, I don't care, bro
Fame won't ever make me change so
I don't care, no, I don't care, no

Honestly, it's bothered me since I've become this famous
People comment like I don't see what they're saying
I get death threats every day and so my family call me garbage, call me racist
Try to tell my therapist that I'm afraid, I can't explain it, uh
Back up, don't touch me, I'm anxious
All of this money I'm banking
Don't make me happy, I can't win
Don't get me wrong, no, I'm thankful
Wanted to catch and inhabit
Pressure form standards established
Amplified anger and sadness
Can't deny that it did damage
Ay, take the box off me
Take off all the chains
Take the braids out of my hair, laser the tattoos off my face
Stop comparing me to Hopsin, Token, NF, and Em
I think they're great, but so am I and I don't wanna be them
And I never change, but I'm not the same
I am not the person that I once was
Alcoholic, I was calling mama, always try to borrow 50 bucks, uh, ay
I put my parents in debt
I even embarrassed my friends
I didn't care if I die, I was honestly hopeful that I wouldn't' wake up again
But I'm back now
Knock me down to that nap and now I stand proud
Last round, believe me I'm ready to strap until they back down
Doctor give me pills, told me I was sad
Never took 'em though, throw 'em into trash
Made a couple mil', money doesn't last
Try to smile a bit, livin' in the past

Everybody says I've changed up, I've changed up
'Cause I had nothing then I came up, came up
Now I'm someone they are afraid of, afraid of
So say some, say some, woah
Ay, yo, everything you say bro
I don't care, no, I don't care, bro
Fame won't ever make me change so
I don't care, no, I don't care, no

See this Gucci? I bought it
I'm not sell-out, homie, stop it
This is symbol of the work I did that's finally acknowledged
This is robbing corner stores while getting soda and some chocolate
This is bullied all my life by kids at school, I ain't forgot it
This is profit that I got from sacrificing food and water
This is dollars I had after finally paying back my father
This is failing grades and skipping class and dropping out of college
You can't stop me, that's your problem
I will get it if I want it (Woah)

Stop telling me that I switched sides
My life changed, I'm a different guy
My mama proud, my girl's stoked
My sister happy I didn't die
They're mad, instead of saying "Tom, I wish you the best"
Of course I changed, I had to go and buy a bulletproof vest
'Cause I'ma stressed, ya
I'm a mess, ya
I need rest, ya
Wastin' energy on enemies I never met, ya
I need meds, ya
I need bed, ya
What the heck?
I should send a text to see if I still have some friends, ya
Now that I'm healthy, and nobody help me
I wanna get every penny, independent
I'm a menace, I'ma wreck it
All my records got a message, I'ma spread it
And I'm still the person my mama nurtured
To become this version, so shoutout mom
I don't ever sleep, every night is long
Everything is on me, Tom

Everybody says I've changed up, I've changed up
'Cause I had nothing then I came up, came up
Now I'm someone they are afraid of, afraid of
So say some, say some, woah
Ay, yo, everything you say bro
I don't care, no, I don't care, bro
Fame won't ever make me change so
I don't care, no, I don't care, no
