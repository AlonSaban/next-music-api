So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in
Drop dead, a bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes have seen no conviction

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in
Ignorance and understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left to stop the bleeding?
How far will we take this?
It's not hard to see through the thickness
So tell me, what would you say?
I'd say it's time to

For this world to stop hating?

And no one knows
That this is worthless to me
So

We're in a war that can't be won
This can't be real
'Cause I don't know what to feel
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe
So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
For this world to believe
