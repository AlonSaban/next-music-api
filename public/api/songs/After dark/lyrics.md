I see you, you see me
How pleasant, this feeling
The moment you hold me
I missed you, I'm sorry
I've given what I have
I've showed you I'm growing
The ashes fall slowly
As your voice consoles me
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
We're swaying to drum beats
In motion, I'm feeling
My patience controlling
The question I won't speak
We're telling the stories
Our laughter, he knows me
We're leaving, we're talking
You're closer, it's calming
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
The night will hold us close and the stars will guide us home
I've been waiting for this moment, we're finally alone
I turn to ask the question, so anxious, my thoughts
Your lips were soft like winter, in your passion, I was lost
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
As the hours pass
I will let you know
That I need to ask
Before I'm alone
How it feels to rest
On your patient lips
To eternal bliss
I'm so glad to know
